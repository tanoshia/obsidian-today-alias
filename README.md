# Today Alias — Obsidian Plugin

**Version 1.5.3**

Shows configurable aliases (e.g. `✘ Today, Mar 10th` / `↩ Yesterday, Mar 9th`) for today's and yesterday's notes in the file explorer, and hides the leading date prefix from all other notes. The underlying filenames — and therefore all date-based sorting — are never touched. Works out of the box with Obsidian's default Daily Notes format (`YYYY-MM-DD`). This is a purely visual change; no files are ever renamed or modified.

## Features

- **Date prefix hiding** — strips the configured date prefix from the displayed title in the file explorer
- **[Moment.js format strings](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/)** — uses the same format system as Obsidian's own Templates and Templater plugins (`YYYY`, `MM`, `DD`, `HH`, `mm`, `Do`, `MMMM`, etc.); no regex required
- **Sort order preserved** — Obsidian sorts by the actual filename; only what you see changes
- **"Today" label** — a Daily Note whose filename matches today's date is shown with a configurable label (default `✘ Today, Mar 10th`), updating automatically when the day rolls over via a window-focus listener, a 60-second background check, and a precise midnight timeout
- **"Yesterday" label** — yesterday's bare Daily Note and pattern-matched notes each get their own configurable label/prefix (default `↩ Yesterday, Mar 9th` / `↩ Yesterday's `), mirroring the Today feature exactly
- **Ignore patterns** — Moment.js format patterns to keep certain filenames fully untouched; bare Daily Notes and Meetings notes are pre-filled by default; `*` is supported as a wildcard; a live preview of each pattern with today's date updates in real time
- **Custom ignore Today label** — ignored-pattern matches that start with today's date get their own configurable label prefix (default `✘ Today's `)
- **Live preview** — every format field shows a real-time preview of how today's date renders with the current string
- **Live rename support** — display updates correctly on every filename rename, no lag or skipped updates
- **Tab title aliasing** — open editor tabs (tab strip + header bar) show the same alias or date-stripped title as the file explorer, updating automatically when tabs are opened, switched, or renamed
- **Auto-migration** — settings saved with the old `{TOKEN}` syntax are silently upgraded to Moment.js equivalents on first load
- **Clean unload** — all elements are restored to plain text when the plugin is disabled or unloaded

## Example

| Filename on disk | Shown in explorer |
|---|---|
| `2026-03-10` *(today, bare daily note)* | `✘ Today, Mar 10th` |
| `2026-03-10 Meetings` *(today, ignored pattern)* | `✘ Today's Meetings` |
| `2026-03-09` *(yesterday, bare daily note)* | `↩ Yesterday, Mar 9th` |
| `2026-03-09 Meetings` *(yesterday, pattern-matched)* | `↩ Yesterday's Meetings` |
| `2026-03-08 Meetings` *(ignored pattern, not today/yesterday)* | `2026-03-08 Meetings` *(unchanged)* |
| `2026-03-08 M! Alice meeting email planning` | `M! Alice meeting email planning` |
| `2026-01-15 Project kickoff` | `Project kickoff` |
| `2026-02-03` *(bare daily note, ignored)* | `2026-02-03` *(unchanged)* |

## How it works

1. On load the plugin attaches a `MutationObserver` to the file-explorer container, watching for all DOM mutations (child additions, text swaps, character data changes).
2. A `vault.on('rename')` listener acts as a safety net to catch any edge cases the observer misses.
3. Whenever a `.nav-file-title-content` element is painted or updated:
   - If the filename exactly equals today's date and **Today** bare-note toggle is on → replaced with the configured Today label (e.g. `✘ Today, Mar 10th`)
   - If the filename exactly equals yesterday's date and **Yesterday** bare-note toggle is on → replaced with the configured Yesterday label (e.g. `↩ Yesterday, Mar 9th`)
   - If the filename matches any **ignore pattern** and the **Today** pattern-prefix toggle is on and it starts with today's date → replaced with the configured prefix + the rest of the filename
   - If the filename matches any **ignore pattern** and the **Yesterday** pattern-prefix toggle is on and it starts with yesterday's date → replaced with the configured prefix + the rest of the filename
   - If the filename matches any **ignore pattern** otherwise → left completely untouched
   - Otherwise the date prefix is wrapped in a hidden `<span class="ta-date">` and the rest shown in `<span class="ta-rest">`
4. Day-rollover is detected by three complementary triggers: a **window focus** listener (fires when you switch back to Obsidian or the system wakes from sleep), a **60-second interval** (catches windows left open without regaining focus), and a precise **midnight timeout** (fires at 00:00:05 for fully-awake sessions). Any trigger that detects a date change calls a shared `checkDateChange()` which prevents duplicate refreshes.
5. On unload every element is restored to its original plain-text form; no trace is left behind.

## Format reference

All format fields use **[Moment.js format strings](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/)** — the same system Obsidian's own Templates and Templater plugins use.

| Token | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `YYYY` | 4-digit year | `2026` |
| `MM` | 2-digit month | `03` |
| `DD` | 2-digit day | `04` |
| `Do` | Day with ordinal | `4th` |
| `MMMM` | Full month name | `March` |
| `HH` | 24-hour hour | `14` |
| `mm` | Minutes | `05` |
| `[text]` | Literal (escaped) text | `[Today -]` |

Full reference: [momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/)

## Settings

Wrap literal text in square brackets to prevent it being treated as a token (e.g. `[Today -]DD`).

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Enable** | `true` | Toggle date-prefix hiding without uninstalling. |
| **Date format** | `YYYY-MM-DD` | Moment.js format of the date prefix at the start of filenames. Matches Obsidian's default Daily Notes format. Example for full datetime: `YYYY-MM-DD[T]HH[:]mm[:]ss[Z]`. |
| **Today** | *(4 inline controls)* | Bare-note toggle + format, pattern-prefix toggle + format. Bare toggle: shows `✘ Today, Mar 10th` for a bare today note. Prefix toggle: prepends `✘ Today's ` to pattern-matched today notes. Both inputs disabled when their toggle is off. |
| **Yesterday** | *(4 inline controls)* | Same structure as Today but for yesterday's date. Defaults: `[↩ Yesterday, ]MMM Do` and `[↩ Yesterday's ]`. |
| **Other pattern matching** | `YYYY-MM-DD` / `YYYY-MM-DD [Meetings]` | One Moment.js pattern per line matched against the full filename. Files that match are left untouched. Use `*` as a wildcard and `[...]` to escape literal words — e.g. `YYYY-MM-DD [Meetings]` (without brackets, `M` would be parsed as a month token). Remove `YYYY-MM-DD` to let the plugin hide the date on bare daily notes (leaving them blank in the explorer). A live preview of each pattern rendered with today's date is shown beneath the field. |

## Installation (manual / development)

```bash
cd ~/MiscCode/obsidian-today-alias
npm install
npm run build          # produces main.js
```

Copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` into your vault's plugin folder:

```
<your vault>/.obsidian/plugins/today-alias/
```

Reload Obsidian (**Ctrl/Cmd+R** in developer mode, or close and reopen), then go to **Settings → Community plugins** and enable **Today Alias**.

## Upgrading from v1.3.x

Settings using the old `{YYYY}-{MM}-{DD}` token syntax are automatically migrated to Moment.js equivalents on first load — no manual action needed.

## Changelog

### v1.5.3 — Today Alias (renamed)
- **Renamed** plugin from *Hide Date Prefix* to *Today Alias* to better reflect its primary purpose
- **feat:** Yesterday label — yesterday's bare Daily Note and pattern-matched notes each get a configurable alias/prefix (mirrors the Today feature exactly)
- **fix:** Prior-day notes now update correctly when the day rolls over; the old Today label no longer persists on the previous day's note
- **feat:** Tab title aliasing — open editor tabs (tab strip + header bar) now show the same alias or date-stripped title as the file explorer

### v1.4.x → v1.5.x
- Moment.js format strings replace the old `{TOKEN}` syntax everywhere (auto-migrated on first load)
- Live format previews in all settings fields
- Responsive Today / Yesterday settings rows

## Why not rename the files?

Renaming would break internal links and require vault reorganisation. This plugin is **purely visual** — filenames, links, frontmatter and every other Obsidian feature are never touched.

## Planned

- [x] ~~Handle custom patterns to ignore (like "YYYY-MM-DD Meetings")~~
- [x] ~~Format date as Obi daily note does ([moment.js](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/))~~
- [x] ~~MIT license (v1.4.5b)~~
- [x] ~~fix: Update "Today" for old notes; issue: prior day's note still displays as custom "today" format next day, needs manual update to fix currently~~
- [x] ~~feat: Add `yesterday` tag (similar to Today unique handling) (v1.5.3)~~
- [x] ~~feat: Rename affected tabs too (consistency) (v1.5.3)~~
- [ ] Publish/submit to Obsidian Community Plugins (v2.0.x)
- [ ] Handle future dated notes differently?
